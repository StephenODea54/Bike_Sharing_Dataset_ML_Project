# Bike_Sharing_Dataset_ML_Project
This repository holds all of the files used for Eastern University's DTSC 691 - Data Science Capstone: Applied Data Science. The goal of the project is to build a supervised regression model to predict the number of individuals that will rent a bike depending on the weather, day of the week, etc. This dataset was made publicly available by the company Capital-Bikeshare in Washington D.C.
